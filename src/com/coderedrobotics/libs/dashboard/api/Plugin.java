/**
 * Interface for the plugin classes.
 *
 * <p>
 * In order for a plugin to be successfully created by a developer, an Init
 * class must be created. This class <b>must</b> be named "Init.java", and be
 * located in the "plugin" package. Then, the developer needs to implement this
 * interface in the <code>Init</code> class. This requires many methods to be
 * overran, all of which are required for the plugin to operate correctly.
 * Please refer to those individual methods to learn what they do and how they
 * work. A sample implementation would be (with only the load and run methods,
 * and the rest omitted):
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * package plugin;
 *
 * public class Init implements Plugin {
 *
 *      public void load() {
 *           //Loading Code
 *      }
 *
 *      public void run() {
 *           //Run Code
 *      }
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <p>
 * Other hooks for plugins may be found in the {@link
 * com.coderedrobotics.libs.dashboard.PluginHooks
 * PluginHooks} class.
